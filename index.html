1. Accuracy
<br>
Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them computational devices. Automated
attendance management system ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable
costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data theory helps to provide
accurate performance and payroll data.
<br>
2. Economics
<br>
Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could contol costs? It
saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, tardiness
time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium group,
found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing
automated attendance management system.
<br>
3. Productivity/Efficiency
<br>
Monitoring and managing attendance manually, usually can be time-consuming, and 
expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, creative
schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up
precious adminiration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from
keeping track of employee hours, to importing information into your payroll system.
The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use
of resources which leads to increased productivity and improves profits, and many 
more like visibility/insights, hasslefree work flow management, flexibility, 
infuration/configuration, real time tracking, security, and compliance.
